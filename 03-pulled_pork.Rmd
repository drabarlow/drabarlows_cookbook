- large onion (sliced)
- 1-2 oranges (sliced)

## Method

1. Remove any string and trim off the pork shoulder. Use kitchen roll to remove any excess liquid

3. Arrange slicked onions and oranges to coat bottom of slow cooker. Place pork shoulder on top
4. Cook on low for 8 hours
5. Remove pork shoulder and place in a large dish to rest. Sieve cooking liquid into a saucepan, removing the onion and orange pieces
6. Reduce the liquid by simmering, until it is thicker and with more concentrated flavour

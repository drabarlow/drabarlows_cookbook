# Guacamole

The secret is mashing the onion in a pastle and mortar...

## Ingredients

- 8 ripe avocados
- 1 large red onion (diced)
- 1.5 tsp salt (chunks, use less if fine grained)
- juice of 2 limes
- 2 tbsp finely chopped coriander leaf

## Method

1. Mash onion and salt to a paste in a pestle and mortar
2. Put avocado flesh in a bowl and mash with a potato masher. I like to keep it chunky.
3. Add half the onion and half the lime juice. **Taste!**
4. Adjust amount of onion and lime juice to your liking
5. Add coriander
6. Serve at room temperature, best eaten same day
